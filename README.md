# ðŸŒŒ Dotfiles

This repository serves as my way to help me setup and maintain my Mac. It takes the effort out of installing everything manually. Everything needed to setup macOS in my preferred way is detailed in this readme. Feel free to explore, learn and copy parts for your own dotfiles. Enjoy!

## Backup your data

If you're migrating from an existing Mac, you should first make sure to backup all of your existing data. Go through the checklist below to make sure you didn't forget anything before you migrate.

- Did you commit and push any changes/branches to your git repositories?
- Did you remember to save all important documents from non-iCloud directories?
- Did you save all of your work from apps which aren't synced through iCloud?
- Did you remember to export important data from your local database?

## Setting up your Mac

After backing up your old Mac you may now follow these install instructions to setup a new one.
